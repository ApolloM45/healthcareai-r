# HCRTools

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/HealthCatalystSLC/HCRTools.svg?token=GcLDmxqBxykNkCM4zaMX&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/HealthCatalystSLC/HCRTools)


The aim of `HCRTools` is to make it easy to do data science with health care 
data. It has three main goals:

-  Allow one to easily create models based on tabular data, and deploy a best
model that pushes predictions to SQL Server

-  Provide tools related to data cleaning, manipulation, and imputation

-  Make data exporation easy via interactive Shiny apps. This is not only for 
data residing (as-is) in SQL Server, but also provides interactivity
with predictions made from a model (based on toggling input options).
